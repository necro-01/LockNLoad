# LockNLoad

LockNLoad is a digital-watermarking tool that is used  to  conceal  data/ownership  in  digital  documents  like  certificates,  stock  images,  etc. to ensure secure data transmission. It leverages the Least Significant Bit (LSB) algorithm for steganography, which hides encrypted messages within images, providing an additional layer of data security.

## Installation

### [ðŸ”ƒDownload](https://github.com/necro-01/LockNLoad/raw/main/bin/LockNload.exe)

## Usage

- Open the tool. Go through the user manual first. (Help -> User manual).

> The manual has all the instructions for the tool.

- For using the RSA algorithm, first generate key-value pairs from the key generator (File -> Key Generator).

## Algorithms

- Digital Steganography: Utilizes the LSB algorithm to embed encrypted data into images.

- Cryptography: Employs AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) algorithms to encrypt messages for data protection.
- Secure Data Retrieval: Corresponding decoding & decrypting algorithms for above mentioned algorithms.
